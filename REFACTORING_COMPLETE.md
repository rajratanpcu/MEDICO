```

### AFTER (Professional)
```

## ✨ Key Changes

### 1. **Applications Consolidated** → `apps/`
- ✅ `backend/` → `apps/backend/`
- ✅ `frontend/` → `apps/frontend/`  
- ✅ `ai-service/` → `apps/ai-service/`

**Why**: Each app is independently deployable with its own dependencies

---

### 2. **Infrastructure Organized** → `infra/`
- ✅ Docker configs → `infra/docker/`
  - docker-compose.yml
  - Dockerfile.backend
  - prometheus.yml
  - logstash.conf
- ✅ Scripts → `infra/scripts/`
  - build-backend.ps1
  - start-dev.ps1
  - test-database.ps1

**Why**: All DevOps and deployment files in one place

---

### 3. **Documentation Centralized** → `docs/`
- ✅ 45+ markdown files → `docs/`
- ✅ Organized into subdirectories:
  - `docs/architecture/` - System design
  - `docs/api/` - Endpoint documentation
  - `docs/deployment/` - Production guides

**Why**: Easy to navigate and reference

---

### 4. **Data & Samples Organized** → `data/`
- ✅ SQL schemas → `data/schemas/`
- ✅ JSON samples → `data/samples/`

**Why**: Test data separate from application code

---

### 5. **Workflows Isolated** → `automation/`
- ✅ n8n workflows → `automation/n8n/`

**Why**: Automation tools are separate concerns

---

## 🔧 Configurations Updated

```yaml
# Frontend

## 🎓 For Your Viva Presentation

**What to Say When Asked About Structure:**

> *"I reorganized the project following industry-standard architectural patterns. The apps/ directory contains independent, deployable services (backend, frontend, AI). Infrastructure code is isolated in infra/, documentation is centralized in docs/, and supporting data is in data/. This structure improves maintainability, facilitates scaling, and demonstrates understanding of enterprise software engineering principles."*
